# Runs the official GenVM linter (genvm-lint, the check stewards use) on contracts/DealGuard.py.
#
# 1. `genvm-lint lint` on the file exactly as deployed.
# 2. `genvm-lint check` + `typecheck` (full SDK validation) on a copy whose header and imports
#    are rewritten to the public py-genlayer runner 1jb45aa8 shipped in GenVM v0.3.0-rc7.
#    Studio Dev (61997) only accepts runner babwp9t3 (GenVM rc10), which is not in any public GenVM
#    release, so the linter cannot download that SDK; the contract body is byte-identical.
